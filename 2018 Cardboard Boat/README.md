# 2018 Society of Freshman Engineers Cardboard Regatta
After just a few weeks of classes in my first semester, the Society of Freshman Eningeers launched their annual carboard boat competition. The rules were simple: two students had paddle across a pool while sitting in a boat made of only cardboard and tape. No glue or plastic would be allowed. Each team was provided with some cardboard and a roll of duct tape, but additional materials had to be procured independently. Having freshly installed SolidWorks on my laptop, I convinced my roommate and a classmate to join me in this competition.

While I started by reasearching best practices in carboard boat design, Michael (front) went dumpster diving for cardboard at a moving company. Calvin (back) helped me with desiging a solid object with a volume of about 12 cubic feet, nearly 3 times the volume of water displaced by the mass of Michael and Calvin. After converting the shape to a sheet metal object, we had a pattern to cut out, and an SUV full of cardboard. Four rolls of duct tape and a few utility knife blades later, we had finished our 7ft tall boat and were ready for the race.
