This was re-designed during my spring break that was extended by the covid-19 pandemic. The PCB silkscreen design features artisitic depictions of the malice that tainted our world.

New Features:
* support for a single encoder per PCB in the bottom left or right corner. Optional switch in encoder will be part of the key switch matrix.
* status LED above the Pro-Micro on each half, controlled by the primary Pro-Micro. (data carried over TRRS cable)
* minimal text and words on the silkscreen. The stripe of the diode goes towards the square pad. Look at the layout file for confirm diode placements

How to Assemble:

How to Use the Encoders:
* To be added when we figure this out.

How to Use the LEDs:
* To be added when we figure this out.
