This was re-designed during my spring break that was extended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PCB silkscreen design features artisitic depictions of the _malice_ that tainted our world.

New Features:
* Support for a single encoder per PCB in the bottom left or right corner.

    * Optional switch in encoder will be part of the key switch matrix.

* Status LED above the Pro-Micro on each half, controlled by the primary Pro-Micro.

    * Data is carried over TRRS cable

* Minimal silkscreen text 

    * Look at the layout file for confirmed diode placements
    * The stripe of the diode goes towards the square pad.

How to Assemble:
* [Let's Split Build Guide](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide)

How to Use the Encoders:
* To be added when we figure this out.

How to Use the LEDs:
* To be added when we figure this out.
