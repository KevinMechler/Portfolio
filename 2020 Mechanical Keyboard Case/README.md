# Keyboard Case Design

[*Please see portfolio page on the PCB this case was made to support*](https://github.com/KevinMechler/Portfolio/tree/master/2020%20Mechanical%20Keyboard)

This keyboard is a derivative of the "Let's Split" 40% split ortholinear keyboard originally made by [u/wootpatoot](https://www.reddit.com/user/wootpatoot/).

The case design is a aderivative of the [Let's Split Keyboard angled case on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2626039)

After completing the "Let's Social Distance" PCB, decided to challenge myself in SolidWorks and create a custom case design.
